Analysis Summary:
  - Charter schools have less students and total school budget than district schools.
  - Students who attend charter schools are likely to achive more academic success. 
  - A higher budget per student does not equate to higher academic success.
  - Schools with large student population academically perform poorly.
  - Charter schools academically perform significantly better than district schools.

  The two main takeaways from our analysis is that charter schools academically perform
better than district schools by about 40%, and that large schools with 2000 to 3000
students academically perform about 30% worse than small (<1000) to medium (1000 to 2000) 
sized schools. This may beattributed to the fact that charter schools typically have less 
students than district schools.
